This is a binding to  openzwave-1.2.919 . It will require you to compile the 
manager_wrapper.c using C with a command such as 

gcc  -I/home/tony/ada/tools/openzwave-1.2.919/cpp/src -c manager_wrapper.cpp

taking note that I keep my built openzwave library in /home/tony/ada/tools/ .

Also in the open_zwave.adb file you will need three pragma linker_options just after 
"package body is"
1) to point to the open_zwave library above 
i.e. mine would be 
pragma Linker_Options ("-L/home/tony/ada/tools/openzwave-1.2.919/");
      
2) to point to the compiled file manager_wrapper.o
i.e. pragma Linker_Options ("where_you_keep_it/manager_wrapper.o")

3) to point to the library stdc++
    i.e. pragma Linker_Options ("-lstdc++");

How I'm using this library

I'm using this to create a home efficiency application to improve central heating.
I'm using a raspberry pi B model 2 running raspbian jessie connected to a AEON Z STICK and 
Stella Z valves!

I apologise in advance about publishing possibly a little early but I would be pleased if people
would contribute.

I am currently writing a demo app with hopefully some helpful extra functions. I will also be releasing the work I
have done on the home efficiency app with a similar license. 

Have fun!
