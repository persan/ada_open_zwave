This is a binding to the  openzwave c library.
Just type "make" and then include the gpr file in your gnat gps project.

You will also need to add the user you running any application using it under to 
the group dialout so the USB port you have your zwave coordinator device attached to.

i.e. for the user tony you would need 'sudo adduser tony dialout' so the usb port you
have connected your Aeon Z2 stick to can be accessed.

How I'm using this library

I'm using this to create a home efficiency application to improve central heating. 
I've called this KushtiBot and will be developing it at github. Its not in any stage to use at the moment 
but feel free to contribute. The meaning of Kushti is "just right" in the Romani language.

I'm using a raspberry pi B model 2 running raspbian jessie connected to a AEON Z STICK and 
Stella Z valves! 

I apologise in advance about publishing possibly a little early but I would be pleased if people
would contribute.

I am currently writing a demo app with hopefully some helpful extra functions. I will also be releasing the work I
have done on the home efficiency app with a similar license. 

Have fun!
